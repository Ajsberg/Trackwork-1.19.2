# Trackwork-1.19.2
Unofficial fork of Create/Valkyrien Skies addon Trackwork for Minecraft Forge 1.19.2

I'm not planning on updating/bugixing this repo and whatever is inside it. Feel free to do as you please with contents of this repo. All questions for updates/bugfixes will be ignored so please don't bother. I just wanted to feel useful for once.

I know almost nothing about programming and was just following this [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h8suY-Osn8Q). If it doesn't work on your end please don't come to me, I just wanted to play with Trackwork in my modpack on 1.19.2.

Original mod by Endalion [here](https://github.com/Endalion/trackwork) (If the author has problems with me doing anything with this mod please contact me on Discord: iceberg3176)

Assets are from [Create Mod](https://github.com/Creators-of-Create/Create)

I also don't have much experience using Github so don't try to kill me over that.
